# Arduino Traffic Light
Traffic light software for Arduino.

## Overview
The Arduino traffic light software is a system where 3 LEDs are used that rappresent the real life traffic light system. You can use toy cars to make it happen and change the code however you want and try other stuff. Add, edit or improve however you want and contribute to the project.

### Requirements for testing
- A computer
- The Arduino IDE Software
- An Arduino board that has GPIO pins enough the connect 3 LEDs. (UNO recommended, MEGA is an another choice.)
- The .ino file inside this repo
- 1 Red LED
- 1 Yellow LED
- 1 Green LED
- 3 to 5 toy cars (completely your choice, 3 to 5 is your best choice)

### Testing
Testing the code is so simple. But before we begin the steps, don't forget to complete the requirements above.

1. Download the repo as .zip to your computer or clone the repo with the command below

     `git clone github.com/TurboProgramming/ArduinoTrafficLight`

2. Find the .ino file inside the folder you got.
3. Launch the Arduino IDE.
4. Load the .ino file included with the repo to the Arduino IDE.
5. Send the code to your Arduino board.
6. Don't forget to connect all the pins like the image below.

### Modifying
Modifying the code is simple as testing. You just need to load the .ino file to the Arduino IDE and modify the code however you want. Add more LEDs, change pin locations and more.

### Contributing
After you modify the code, you can fork the repo and open a PR. Your contributions will be reviewed and merged to the repo.
